**Product Placement System**

A sophisticated AI-powered product placement system that automatically generates realistic product placement images for advertising and marketing purposes. The system combines advanced image processing, AI-powered background generation, and intelligent product positioning to create professional-quality product placement images.

**Overview**

This system takes a product image and creates a realistic advertisement by placing the product in a generated or provided background scene. It uses multiple AI models to enhance product images, remove backgrounds, generate contextually appropriate backgrounds, and intelligently position products for maximum visual impact.

**Key Features**

**Intelligent Background Removal**: Automatically removes product backgrounds using advanced AI segmentation while preserving product details and transparency
**Smart Image Processing**: Handles various image formats and automatically converts them for optimal processing

**Background Generation**

**AI-Powered Scene Creation**: Generates photorealistic backgrounds using **Flux diffusion** model based on text prompts
**Contextual Awareness**: Creates backgrounds that are contextually appropriate for the specified product placement location
**High-Quality Output**: Generates backgrounds in high resolution with natural lighting and realistic environments

**Intelligent Product Analysis**

**AI-Powered Product Recognition**: Uses **GPT-4 Vision** to analyze products and determine their identity and characteristics
**Smart Sizing Recommendations**: Automatically calculates appropriate product sizing based on background context and advertising best practices
**Proportional Scaling**: Ensures products are sized appropriately for natural-looking placement while maintaining visibility for advertising purposes

**Advanced Placement Technology**

**Object Detection**: Uses **GroundingDINO** model to detect and locate specific placement surfaces like tables, countertops, or other specified locations
**Surface-Aware Positioning**: Intelligently positions products on detected surfaces with proper alignment and realistic placement
**Natural Integration**: Applies subtle effects like edge feathering and brightness adjustment to make products blend naturally with backgrounds

**Professional Output Features**

**High-Quality Composition**: Creates professional-grade product placement images suitable for advertising campaigns
**Automatic Image Hosting**: Uploads final images to image hosting services and provides public URLs
**Multiple Format Support**: Handles various input formats and outputs in web-optimized formats

**How It Works**

**Step 1: Product Image Enhancement**
The system begins by analyzing the uploaded product image and enhancing its quality using Real-ESRGAN AI upscaling technology. This step improves text readability, sharpens details, and prepares the image for optimal processing.

**Step 2: Background Removal**
Advanced AI segmentation removes the original background from the product image while preserving fine details like shadows, transparency, and edge information. This creates a clean product cutout ready for placement.

**Step 3: Background Generation**
Based on the provided text prompt, the system generates a photorealistic background scene using state-of-the-art Flux diffusion models. The background is created with consideration for the specified placement location and natural lighting conditions.

**Step 4: Intelligent Analysis**
The system uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze both the product and generated background, determining the optimal size and positioning for the product. This analysis considers advertising best practices, ensuring the product is prominently visible while maintaining natural proportions.

**Step 5: Placement Detection**
GroundingDINO object detection algorithms identify the exact location where the product should be placed within the background scene. The system can detect various surfaces and objects like tables, countertops, shelves, or other specified placement areas.

**Step 6: Professional Composition**
The product is carefully positioned and integrated into the background with professional techniques including proper scaling, alignment, edge blending, and lighting adjustments. The final result is a cohesive, natural-looking product placement image.

**Step 7: Output Generation**
The completed image is saved in high quality and automatically uploaded to image hosting services, providing immediate access via public URLs for use in marketing campaigns.

**API Integration**

**Asynchronous Processing**
The system includes a **FastAPI**-based web service that handles requests asynchronously, allowing for efficient processing of multiple images simultaneously without blocking operations.

**Webhook Notifications**
Automatic webhook notifications inform clients when processing is complete, including status updates and links to the final images.

**Job Tracking**
Each processing request receives a unique job ID for tracking progress and retrieving results, with detailed status information available throughout the process.

**File Management**
Secure file handling with automatic cleanup of temporary files and organized output storage with public URL generation.

**Use Cases**

**Advertising Campaigns**
Create professional product placement images for digital and print advertising without expensive photo shoots or studio setups.

**E-commerce Enhancement**
Generate lifestyle images showing products in realistic environments to improve online product presentations and increase conversion rates.

**Social Media Marketing**
